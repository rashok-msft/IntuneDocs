# iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune

This article lists and describes the different settings you can control on iOS and iPadOS devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to allow or disable features, set password rules, allow or restrict specific apps, and more.

These settings are added to a device configuration profile in Intune, and then assigned or deployed to your iOS devices.

> [!TIP]
> These settings use Apple's MDM settings. For more information on these settings, see [Apple's mobile device management settings](https://support.apple.com/guide/mdm/welcome/web) (opens Apple's web site).

## Before you begin

[Create a device restrictions configuration profile](../device-restrictions-configure.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These settings apply to different enrollment types, with some settings applying to all enrollment options. For more information on the different enrollment types, see [iOS enrollment](../ios-enroll.md).

## General

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 9.3.2 and newer

- **Remote screen observation by Classroom app**: Choose **Block** to prevent the Classroom app from remotely viewing the screen on the device. **Not configured** (default) allows the Apple Classroom app to view the screen.

  To use this setting, set the **Screen capture** setting to **Block**.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 9.3 and newer

- **Unprompted screen observation by Classroom app**: If set to **Allow**, teachers can silently observe the screen of students iOS devices using the Classroom app without the students' knowledge. Student devices enrolled in a class using the Classroom app automatically give permission to that courseâ€™s teacher. **Not configured** (default) prevents this feature.

  To use this setting, set the **Screen capture** setting to **Block**.

- **Enterprise app trust**: Choose **Block** to remove the **Trust Enterprise Developer** button in Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management on the device. **Not configured** (default) lets the user choose to trust apps that aren't downloaded from the app store.
- **Account modification**: When set to **Block**, the user can't update the device-specific settings from the iOS settings app. For example, the user can't create new device accounts, or change the user name or password. **Not configured** (default) allows users to change these settings.

  This feature also applies to settings accessible from the iOS settings app, such as Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Twitter, and more. This feature doesn't apply to apps with account settings that aren't configurable from the iOS settings app, such as the Microsoft Outlook app.

- **Screen time**: Choose **Block** to prevent users from setting their own restrictions in Screen Time (device settings). **Not configured** allows the user to configure device restrictions (such as parental controls or content, and privacy restrictions) on the device.

  This setting was renamed from **Enabling restrictions in the device settings**. Impact of this change:  
  
  - iOS 11.4.1 and earlier: **Block** prevents end users from setting their own restrictions in the device settings. The behavior is the same; and there are no changes for end users.
  - iOS 12.0 and newer: **Block** prevents end users from setting their own **Screen Time** in the device settings (Settings > General > Screen Time), including content and privacy restrictions. Devices upgraded to iOS 12.0 won't see the restrictions tab in the device settings anymore (Settings > General > Device Management > Management Profile > Restrictions). These settings are in **Screen Time**.

- **Require students to request permission to leave Classroom course**: **Require** forces students enrolled in an unmanaged course using the Classroom app to request permission from the teacher to leave the course. **Not configured** (default) doesn't force the student to ask for permission.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 11.3 and newer

- **Allow Classroom to lock to an app and lock the device without prompting**: **Enable** allows teacher to lock apps or lock the device using the Classroom app without prompting the student. Locking apps means the device can only access teacher specified apps. **Not configured** (default) prevents teachers from locking apps or devices using the Classroom app without prompting the student.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 11.0 and newer

- **Automatically join Classroom classes without prompting**: **Enable** automatically allows students to join a class that is in the Classroom app without prompting the teacher. **Not configured** (default) prompts the teacher that students want to join a class that is in the Classroom app.

- **Block VPN creation**: **Block** prevents users from creating VPN configuration settings. **Not configured** (default) lets users create VPNs on the device.
- **Modifying eSIM settings**: **Block** prevents users from removing or adding a cellular plan to the eSIM on the device. **Not configured** (default) allows users to change these settings.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 12.1 and newer

- **Defer software updates**: When set to **Not configured** (default), software updates are shown on the device as Apple releases them. For example, if an iOS update gets released by Apple on a specific date, then that update naturally shows up on the device around the release date.

  **Enable** allows you to delay when software updates are shown on devices, from 0-90 days. This setting doesn't control when updates are or aren't installed. 

  - **Delay visibility of software updates**: Enter a value from 0-90 days. When the delay expires, users get a notification to update to the earliest version of the OS available when the delay was triggered.

    For example, if iOS 12.a is available on **January 1**, and **Delay visibility** is set to **5 days**, then iOS 12.a isn't shown as an available update on end user devices. On the **sixth day** following the release, that update is available, and end users can install it.

    This setting applies to:  
    - iOS 11.3 and newer

## Password

### Settings apply to: All enrollment types

- **Password**: **Require** the end user to enter a password to access the device. **Not configured** (default) allows users to access the device without entering a password.

### Settings apply to: Device enrollment, Automated device enrollment (supervised)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On user-enrolled devices, if you configure any password setting, then the **Simple passwords** settings is automatically set to **Block**, and a 6 digit PIN is enforced.
>
> For example, you configure the **Password expiration** setting, and push this policy to user-enrolled devices. On the devices, the following happens:
>
> - The **Password expiration** setting is ignored.
> - Simple passwords, such as `1111` or `1234`, aren't allowed.
> - A 6 digit pin is enforced.

- **Simple passwords**: Choose **Block** to require more complex passwords. **Not configured** allows simple passwords, such as `0000` and `1234`.

- **Required password type**: Choose the type of password your organization require. Your options:
  - **Device default**
  - **Numeric**
  - **Alphanumeric**
- **Number of non-alphanumeric characters in password**: Enter the number of symbol characters, such as `#` or `@`, that must be included in the password.

- **Minimum password length**: Enter the minimum length a user must enter, between 4 and 14 characters. On user enrolled devices, enter a length between 4 and 6 characters.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > For devices that are user enrolled, users can set a PIN greater than 6 digits. But, no more than 6 digits are enforced on the device. For example, an administrator sets the minimum length to `8`. On user-enrolled devices, users are only required to set a 6 digit PIN. Intune doesn't force a PIN greater than 6 digits on user-enrolled devices.

- **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device**: Enter the number of failed sign-ins to allow before the device is wiped (between 4-11).
  
  iOS has built-in security that can impact this setting. For example, iOS may delay triggering the policy depending on the number of sign in failures. It may also consider repeatedly entering the same passcode as one attempt. Apple's [iOS security guide](https://www.apple.com/business/site/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) (opens Apple's web site) is a good resource, and provides more specific details on passcodes.
  
- **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required**<sup>1</sup>: Enter how long the device stays idle before the user must reenter their password. If the time you enter is longer than what's currently set on the device, then the device ignores the time you enter. Supported on iOS 8.0 and newer devices.

- **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks**<sup>1</sup>: Enter the maximum number of minutes of inactivity allowed on the device until the screen locks.

  **iOS options**:  

  - **Not configured** (Default): Intune doesn't touch this setting.
  - **Immediately**: Screen locks after 30 seconds of inactivity.
  - **1**: Screen locks after 1 minute of inactivity.
  - **2**: Screen locks after 2 minutes of inactivity.
  - **3**: Screen locks after 3 minutes of inactivity.
  - **4**: Screen locks after 4 minutes of inactivity.
  - **5**: Screen locks after 5 minutes of inactivity.
    
  **iPadOS options**:  

  - **Not configured** (Default): Intune doesn't touch this setting.
  - **Immediately**: Screen locks after 2 minutes of inactivity.
  - **2**: Screen locks after 2 minutes of inactivity.
  - **5**: Screen locks after 5 minutes of inactivity.
  - **10**: Screen locks after 10 minutes of inactivity.
  - **15**: Screen locks after 15 minutes of inactivity.

  If a value doesn't apply to iOS or iPadOS, then Apple uses the closest *lowest* value. For example, if you enter `4` minutes, then iPadOS devices use `2` minutes. If you enter `10` minutes, then iOS devices use `5` minutes. This is an Apple limitation.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > The Intune UI for this setting doesn't separate the iOS and iPadOS supported values. The UI might be updated in a future release.

- **Password expiration (days)**: Enter the number of days before the device password must be changed.
- **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**: Enter the number of new passwords that must be used until an old one can be reused.
- **Touch ID and Face ID unlock**: Choose **Block** to prevent using a fingerprint or face to unlock the device. **Not configured** allows the user to unlock the device using these methods.

  Blocking this setting also prevents using FaceID authentication to unlock the device.

  Face ID applies to:  
  - iOS 11.0 and newer

### Settings apply to: Automated device enrollment (supervised)

- **Passcode modification**: Choose **Block** to stop the passcode from being changed, added, or removed. Changes to passcode restrictions are ignored on supervised devices after blocking this feature. **Not configured** (default) allows passcodes to be added, changed, or removed.

  - **Touch ID and Face ID modification**: **Block** stops the user from changing, adding, or removing TouchID fingerprints and Face ID. **Not configured** (default) allows the user to update the TouchID fingerprints and Face ID on the device.

    Blocking this setting also stops the user from changing, adding, or removing FaceID authentication.

    Face ID applies to:  
    - iOS 11.0 and newer

- **Block password AutoFill**: Choose **Block** to prevent using the AutoFill Passwords feature on iOS. Choosing **Block** also has the following impact:

  - Users aren't prompted to use a saved password in Safari or in any apps.
  - Automatic Strong Passwords are disabled, and strong passwords aren't suggested to users.

  **Not configured** (default) allows these features.

- **Block password proximity requests**: Choose **Block** so a userâ€™s device doesn't request passwords from nearby devices. **Not configured** (default) allows these password requests.
- **Block password sharing**: **Block** prevents sharing passwords between devices using AirDrop. **Not configured** (default) allows passwords to be shared.
- **Require Touch ID or Face ID authentication for password or credit card information AutoFill**: When set to **Require**, users must authenticate using TouchID or FaceID before passwords or credit card information can be auto filled in Safari and other apps. **Not configured** (default) allows users to control this feature in the device settings.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 11.0 and newer
  
<sup>1</sup>When you configure the **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks** and **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required** settings, they're applied in sequence. For example, if you set the value for both settings to **5** minutes, the screen turns off automatically after five minutes, and the device is locked after an additional five minutes. However, if the user turns off the screen manually, the second setting is immediately applied. In the same example, after the user turns off the screen, the device locks five minutes later.
